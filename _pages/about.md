Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Robotics at WPI, where I direct the [Cognitive Medical Technology and Robotics Lab](http://comet-lab.github.io/).

In the past I was a postdoc at [Vanderbilt University](http://research.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/MEDLab/). I did my PhD at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it). See my full CV [here][1].
